1. Copy the files to your own directory.

2. Modify inet.h to reflect the host you are currently logged into.
   (use hostname and nslookup to determine the local IP address)
   Also, modify the port numbers to be used to reduce the likelihood
   of conflicting with another server. Check to see if the selected
   port is in use by using the command: netstat -an | grep <port #>

3. Compile the source code using the command: make.

4. Start the server in the background: server5 &

5. Start the client on the same or another host in the foreground: client5
